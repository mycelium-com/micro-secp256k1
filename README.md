# Tyny secp256k1 implementation

This code was taken from micro-ecc project. It's basically unchanged, however, some of functionality has been removed:

* Random generator function;
* Non-deterministic signing;
* Private key generation;
* Key exchange functionality;
* Support for all curves with exception for secp256k1.
